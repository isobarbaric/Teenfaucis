### Teenfaucis!

### How to Run Teenfauci's Python Script
After cloning this particular repository, to run this repository, you must delete the ``news_channels`` directory for the project to run without errors. 

If an IDE is being used, this can be done through the IDE itself, however, if not, then the following commands can be used to remove the ``news_channels`` directory using the terminal (ensure that you are in the directory where the project was cloned):

for Linux, Windows, and Mac:
```
cd Teenfaucis
rm -rf news_channels
```

After doing this, running ``main.py`` will run the project! Cheers!
