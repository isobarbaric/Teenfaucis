The analysis treats a particular geographic context and so it\'s not possible to say how widely it could be replicated. Even so, the idea that significantly positive increases in rainfall in a part of the world very much in need of more rain could be a side-effect of large scale photovoltaic power installations is not only quite surprising but also quite tantalizing. In this case, it seems possible that at PV plant scales the authors concede are large, water sufficent for the needs of 2.5 million people could be delivered by rainfall to areas already having catchment and reservoir capacity to gather and store it.   Sea Breeze Geoengineering to Increase Rainfall over the Arabian Red Sea Coastal Plains (pdf) published in the AMS Journal of Hydrometeorology by Suleiman Mostamandi et al. explains how this may be possible. Open access and free to read.\r\n\'Alarming\' recent change in an important river\r\nIrina Panyushkina et al. identify evidence  of  very recent and large differences in the behavior of the largest river draining into the Arctic Ocean, in Unprecedented acceleration of winter discharge of Upper Yenisei River inferred from tree rings (pdf), published in Environmental Research Letters. Paying careful attention to details of climate influences on ring growth, the authors vastly extend the paleohydrographic record for the Yenisei, deep into the 18th century.  They find no precedent in the past 214 years for sudden changes in very recent years, specifically an increase of 80% in winter surge flows. Permafrost melting and warming-induced fires appear to drive this and ultimately result in yet another unfortunate feedback process. The article is open access and free to read. From the abstract:\r\n\r\nWe discuss the impact on the baseflow rate change of both the accelerating permafrost warming in the discontinuous zone of South Siberia and widespread forest fires. The winter discharge accounts for only one third of the annual flow, yet the persistent 25 year upsurge is alarming. This trend is likely caused by Arctic Amplification, which can be further magnified by increased winter flow delivering significantly more fresh water to the Kara Sea during the cold season.\r\n\r\n90 articles in 36 journals by 531 contributing authors\r\nPhysical science of climate change, effects\r\nDecoding the dynamics of poleward shifting climate zones using aqua-planet model simulations Yang et al.

Read the original article.\r\n Wildfires that swept through Sequoia National Forest in California in September 2021 were so severe they killed ancient trees that had adapted to survive fires. AP Photo/Noah Berger Shuang-Ye Wu, University of Dayton\r\nAlongside a lingering global pandemic, the year 2021 was filled with climate disasters, some so intense they surprised even the scientists who study them.\r\nExtreme rainstorms turned to raging flash floods that swept through mountain towns in Europe, killing over 200 people. Across Asia, excessive rainfall inundated wide areas and flooded subway stations in China. Heat waves shattered records in the Pacific Northwest, Europe and the Arctic. Wildfires swept through communities in California, Canada, Greece and Australia.\r\nThe area around Boulder, Colorado, was so unusually dry on Dec. 30, 2021, that a powerful wind storm sent grass fires racing through neighborhoods in Superior and Louisville, burning hundreds of homes in a matter of hours. Officials said the winds were so strong, there was little firefighters could do but evacuate homes and businesses in the fires’ paths.\r\nIn the U.S. alone, damage from the biggest climate and weather disasters is expected to total well over US$100 billion in 2021. Many of these extreme weather events have been linked to human-caused climate change, and they offer a glimpse of what to expect in a rapidly warming world.\r\nIn the U.S., something in particular stood out: a sharp national precipitation divide, with one side of the country too wet, the other too dry.\r\n\r\nAs a climate scientist, I study the impact of global warming on precipitation and the water cycle. Here’s what happened with precipitation in the U.S. in 2021 and why we’re likely to see similar scenarios in the future.\r\n\n\tRead more...\n\t0 comments\n\t\r\n\n\tHow to make climate action your New Year\xe2\x80\x99s resolution\n\tPosted on 4 January 2022 by Guest Author\n\tThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections\r\n\r\n\r\nLots of people embrace New Year’s as a time to commit to exercising, getting organized, or saving money.\r\n“It’s a very strong symbolic moment where people resolve to make changes in their lives,” says Daniela Tejada of the “Count Us In” campaign.\r\nShe says New Year’s is the perfect occasion to commit to helping reduce climate change.\r\n“Count Us In” is an online platform where people pledge to take specific actions to reduce carbon pollution. For example, participants make lifestyle changes such as turning down the thermostat or driving less, or they encourage their policymakers to take climate action.\r\n“We want to make sure that individuals are empowered to take action that’s practical and impactful,” Tejada says.\r\nShe says that since the project launched in 2020, about 200,000 people have made a pledge.\r\nAnd now, the campaign is partnering with “Don’t Look Up,” Adam McKay’s new movie on Netflix, to encourage viewers to get involved.\r\nTejada says that together, people’s individual actions can add up to significant cuts in carbon pollution.\r\nAnd she says that the pledges send an important signal to policymakers and business leaders: that voters and consumers are serious about reducing climate change, and they should get serious, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\tRead more...\n\t0 comments\n\t\r\n\n\tHow weather forecasts can spark a new kind of extreme-event attribution\n\tPosted on 3 January 2022 by Guest Author\n\tThis is a re-post from Carbon Brief \r\nExtreme weather events across the world this year have been hitting the headlines at an alarming rate.\r\nTo name a few, 2021 has seen flooding in central Europe, China and New York, a record temperature of 49.6C in Canada and wildfires in Siberia, North America and the Mediterranean.\r\nWith each tragic event comes the question of whether human-caused climate change made it more severe or more likely. The burgeoning field of climate change “attribution” has stepped up to the challenge. While 10 years ago it might have taken months to fully analyse an individual weather event, scientists are now able to provide an answer in just days or weeks. \r\nBecause we cannot make direct observations of a world without human influence on the climate, all attempts to answer this question involve some kind of modelling. However, traditional climate models can struggle to simulate the most extreme weather events. To deal with these compromises, researchers have traditionally relied on comparing results from several different approaches to assess the robustness of their conclusions.\r\nWe suggest that a better approach would be to use numerical models that have demonstrated their ability to simulate the event in question through a successful – or at least reliable – weather or seasonal forecast.\r\nIn our recent study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, we demonstrate – for the first time – an attribution study that uses a state-of-the-art operational weather forecast model. We tested our approach by assessing the European winter heatwave of 2019 – an event the model successfully predicted.\r\nWe find that the direct impact of the extra carbon dioxide (CO2) that humans have pumped into the atmosphere made the event 42% more likely for the British Isles and at least 100% (two times) more likely for France.\r\n\n\tRead more...\n\t11 comments\n\t\r\n\n\t2021 SkS Weekly Climate Change & Global Warming News Roundup #53\n\tPosted on 2 January 2022 by BaerbelW \n\tListing of articles linked to on the Skeptical Science Facebook Page during the past week: Sun, December 26, 2021 through Sat, January 1, 2021.

For one, quite some research was cranked out - i.e. published - by team members and for another, a particular Cranky Uncle started to make the rounds throughout the year.  As in previous recaps, this one is divided into several sections:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSkeptical Science Inc.\r\nScholary publications, projects and books\r\nOther publications and activities\r\nProjects\r\n\r\nCranky Uncle\r\nCARDS\r\n4D\r\n\r\nConferences\r\nRecorded talks and podcasts\r\nOur MOOC Denial101x\r\nTeam News\r\nWebsite activities\r\n\r\nBlog posts\r\nRebuttals\r\nCollaborations\r\nTranslations\r\n\r\nSocial media\r\nOutlook\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\tRead more...\n\t0 comments\n\t\r\n\n\tSkeptical Science New Research for Week #52, 2021\n\tPosted on 30 December 2021 by Doug Bostrom, Marc Kodack\n\t2021 New Research Statistics\r\nThis past year in New Research we\'ve listed 5,495 articles dealing with essentially all aspects of our accidental unleashing of harmfully rapid climate change. Due to data source limitations we do not have an exact count but at least 30,793 researchers contributed to findings covered in these publications, in some 193 separate journals. An encouraging feature is that over a very few years a key statistic has improved; of the total listings for 2021 no fewer than 3,191 are open-access by one means or another, all legal. \r\nMuch of New Research assembly is automated. That said, manual labor is required for compilation. Given a total year\'s visiting readership of ~128,500 persons and a reasonable estimate of weekly time committed to assembly, it required a little under 6.5 seconds to serve each reader, for a total investment of  ~235 hours. That time was mostly spent sieving for relevance through machine-collected raw material comprising somewhere in the neighborhood of 50,000 articles over 2021\'s span, for ~2.5 minutes invested per final article listing. Retention of article contents in the editorial mind hovers at ~0.\r\nUnfortunately it\'s the case that we\'re not by any means comprehensive in this effort. There is simply not enough time to be complete.\r\nWhy New Research?\r\nOne of the reasons for maintaining New Research is to maintain a broad survey of consensus on anthropogenic climate change in current peer-reviewed scientific literature, by direct examination. We don\'t filter on articles dependent on whether there\'s agreement or disagreement with the concept of anthropogenic climate change. With that in mind, it\'s of interest to note that there is but a single paper in this past year\'s listings offering an open disagreement and alternative fundamental mechanism for some of the excess energy we\'re accumulating on Earth. We leave it as an exercise for the reader to find that article. \r\nMore generally on the topic of consensus, the collection of disciplines contributing to papers appearing here is quite large. From competencies core to the study of the physics of climate change and extending to specialties including economics, agriculture, hydrology and more, there is no point of disagreement about the root problem we\'re all facing with climate change. Careful perusal of the entire collection of 2021\'s New Research listings will reveal a handful of articles ranging from neutral to positive regarding some few particular aspects of our changed, changing climate, but these also are predicated on facts and not wishful thinking.  \r\n78 articles in 38 journals by 505 contributing authors\r\nPhysical science of climate change, effects\r\nScale Sensitivity of the Gill Circulation.

But as the planet rapidly warms, what happens in this icy region, where temperatures are rising twice as fast as the rest of the globe, increasingly affects lives around the world.\r\nOn Dec. 14, 2021, a team of 111 scientists from 12 countries released the 16th annual Arctic Report Card, a yearly update on the state of the Arctic system. We are Arctic scientists and the editors of this peer-reviewed assessment. In the report, we take a diverse look across the region’s interconnected physical, ecological and human components.\r\nLike an annual checkup with a physician, the report assesses the Arctic’s vital signs – including surface air temperatures, sea surface temperatures, sea ice, snow cover, the Greenland ice sheet, greening of the tundra, and photosynthesis rates by ocean algae – while inquiring into other indicators of health and emerging factors that shed light on the trajectory of Arctic changes.\r\nAs the report describes, rapid and pronounced human-caused warming continues to drive most of the changes, and ultimately is paving the way for disruptions that affect ecosystems and communities far and wide.\r\n\r\n\n\tRead more...\n\t0 comments\n\t\r\n\n\t2021 SkS Weekly Climate Change & Global Warming News Roundup #52\n\tPosted on 26 December 2021 by BaerbelW \n\tListing of articles linked to on the Skeptical Science Facebook Page during the past week: Sun, December 19, 2021 through Sat, December 25, 2021\r\nThe following articles sparked above average interest during the week: Climate change: Small army of volunteers keeping deniers off Wikipedia , From the eMail Bag: the Beer-Lambert Law and CO2 Concentrations, At least 97% of experts agree that climate change is real and caused by humans.

Our initiatives ensure that scientists can conduct, publish, and discuss their research and advocate for science without the threat of political harassment or legal intimidation.\r\nOur goals are simple: We want scientists to be able to focus on understanding climate change, threats to public health, and other critical human and environmental issues — and we want to ensure trust in science." \r\n— Climate Science Legal Defense Fund\r\n"Extreme times lead to extreme measures." Science has enabled us to understand that we\'re entering an era of extreme peril, caused by extreme effects of our extreme employment of fossil fuels and requiring our concerted, extreme effort to remedy. Meanwhile, extreme amounts of money will change direction as a necessary outcome of our improved cognition, resulting in extreme, untoward behaviors on the part of those feeling threatened by mandatory changes we must make.\r\nSkeptical Science is only one outcome of this wild landscape of extremity. Otherwise uncontroversial scientific knowledge and research progress following a smooth continuum of "we now know better" has become the victim of intentional distortion and manipulation in the public mind, colateral damage in a war to freeze our clock at "fossil." Skeptical Science works specifically to help the public combat its own victimization at the hands of people needing to employ deceit to cause confusion and policy paralysis. \r\nAnother specific task: defend the integrity of science and the safety of scientists as legal matters, a beat the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund has been diligently working for a decade.\r\nWhy is there a Climate Science Legal Defense Fund? CSLDF is a response to extreme legal misbehavior. Arguably much more than the scientific world, our laws and juridical machinery are subject to what can be termed "hacking," exploitation by breaking of norms. Beginning perhaps most infamously with hounding of Professor Michael Mann over the revelation of the "hockey stick graph," proxies for the fossil fuel industry often (ironically) operating in the guise of "thinktanks" have thrown buckets of sand into the gears of scientific research, wasted incalculable amounts of precious time both in the lab and in the "real" world.  While so doing these mercenary forces have turned a lot of lives upside down— to no good end or purpose and in extreme poor faith and poor keeping with our precious, hard-earned freedom and right to enjoy good law and good legal practice in full good faith with the basic objective of our law: fairness. \r\nThe Climate Science Legal Defense Fund  (CSLDF) is akin to Skeptical Science. CSLDF also is an outcome of extreme, transgressive, self-interested exploitation and abuse of another of our great achievements, that of our bodies of law and our legal systems.\r\nHere are some of the things CSLDF has done in the past 10 years to defend our scientists and our legal systems from bad faith:\r\n\n\tRead more...\n\t0 comments\n\t\r\n\n\tSkeptical Science New Research for Week #51, 2021\n\tPosted on 23 December 2021 by Doug Bostrom, Marc Kodack\n\t122 articles in 90 journals by 735 contributing authors\r\nPhysical science of climate change, effects\r\nInterpreting Observed Temperature Probability Distributions Using a Relationship between Temperature and Temperature Advection Linz & Chen Journal of Climate Open Access pdf 10.1175/jcli-d-20-0920.1\r\nAn assessment of radiative impacts of CO2 on baroclinic instability using idealized life cycles Kaviani et al.

Manchin’s primary concerns do not apply to the climate provisions in the bill, and can be overcome through re-negotiating and restructuring. The reservations he expressed regarding clean energy spending are inaccurate.\r\nBuild Back Better\'s Structure and Economic Impacts\r\nCongressional Democrats initially proposed a BBB package that included $3.5 trillion in investments, with plans to pay for the whole bill so as not to add to the national debt. Senator Manchin made clear that he would not vote in favor of a package more than half that size. This left congressional Democrats with two options: remove a number of provisions entirely, or scale them back by funding many policies for a shorter timeframe than the usual 10-year window.\r\nMembers of Congress were divided on this question. Many progressives favored the latter option, and won out in the previous BBB negotiations. Senator Manchin has long expressed his concern that this short-term funding approach is a “gimmick” because, hypothetically, future congresses could extend the programs’ funding without paying for those extensions, thus adding to the debt (although as a member of the Senate, Manchin would have an influential voice and vote on such extensions).\r\nThe good news is that this objection can be overcome by revising BBB to only include policies that are fully paid for over the 10-year window. The even better news is that the climate provisions in the package are already fully paid for. \r\nSenator Manchin also expressed concern about inflation; however, a veritable parade of economists have said that BBB will not worsen inflationary pressures, and 17 Nobel Prize winners argued, “Because this agenda invests in long-term economic capacity and will enhance the ability of more Americans to participate productively in the economy, it will ease longer-term inflationary pressures.” Moreover, in the wake of Senator Manchin’s announcement, economists from Goldman Sachs and Moody’s Analytics downgraded their forecasts of US economic and employment growth over the next year, indicating that BBB would benefit the US economy.\r\nIt’s also worth noting that a price on carbon pollution could generate even more revenue without adding to inflation, were one added to BBB.\r\nThe Climate Investments\r\nSenator Manchin also expressed concern that “the bill will also risk the reliability of our electric grid and increase our dependence on foreign supply chains.” These worries are unfounded. As supporting examples, Manchin referenced power outages in California and Texas, which were caused by extreme weather events. In Texas in particular, last winter’s outages were largely caused by frozen fossil fuel supplies and an isolated power grid. California’s very limited blackouts (affecting only about 2% of state residents, for between a few minutes and 2 ½ hours) in the summer of 2020 were largely caused by poor grid operator planning during an intense heatwave.\r\n\n\tRead more...\n\t10 comments\n\t\r\n\n\tFrom the eMail Bag: the Beer-Lambert Law and CO2 Concentrations\n\tPosted on 20 December 2021 by Bob Loblaw\n\tWe occasionally receive excellent questions and/or comments by email or via our contact form and have then usually corresponded with the emailer directly. But, some of the questions and answers deserve a broader audience, so we decided to highlight some of them in a new series of blog posts.\r\nRecently, an email asked about CO2 and the absorption of infrared (IR) radiation (specifically mentioning the 15 μm wavelength). The email mentioned the Beer-Lambert Law, and went on to ask how a gas can have any effect at low concentrations (400 ppm, or 0.04% of the atmosphere).This post will attempt to explain what the Beer-Lambert Law tells us about the absorption of radiation, and explain why 400 ppm of CO2 can still be an important factor. We’ll look at some of the differences between visible light and IR radiation, and perform a small experiment to show that how we measure “concentration” is important.\r\n\r\n \r\nFigure 1. Lighting at sunset - atmospheric radiation transfer at work\r\nBackground\r\nIt is well known that different wavelengths of light interact differently with the atmosphere. An example we are all familiar with is the difference in lighting between mid-day and twilight. At mid-day, we see a normal (to our human eyes) distribution of the spectrum of light - a balance between the various colours of the rainbow we all learn in school: red, orange, yellow, green blue, indigo, and violet. As the sun sets, the long path the light takes through the atmosphere means we see a colour distribution with much more red in it. To the delight of photographers worldwide, there is a special quality to the lighting that makes landscapes change their appearance (figure 1).There is also a very strong difference between the way solar radiation (from the sun) and terrestrial radiation (emitted within the earth-atmosphere system) interact with the atmosphere. Solar radiation comes in the UV, visible and near-infrared portions of the spectrum, and terrestrial radiation is in the infrared. Figure 2 shows the theoretical Planck curves for radiation emitted from two sources – one at a temperature of 5800K (similar to the sun), and the other at 255K (typical of the earth-atmosphere system).\r\nEach follows a curve, with a peak somewhere in the middle. Solar radiation is mostly in the visible range, between 0.4 and 0.7 μm, and nearly all the energy falls between about 0.2 and 2 μm. Terrestrial radiation peaks at just over 10 μm, and nearly all the energy falls in the range between 4 and 40 μm. We can see that the two ranges do not overlap in the portions of the spectrum where most radiation is emitted from each source.\r\n\n\tRead more...\n\t19 comments\n\t\r\n\n\t2021 SkS Weekly Climate Change & Global Warming News Roundup #51\n\tPosted on 19 December 2021 by BaerbelW \n\tListing of articles linked to on the Skeptical Science Facebook Page during the past week: Sun, December 12, 2021 through Sat, December 18, 2021\r\nThe following articles sparked above average interest during the week: Scientists discover ‘surprising’ cause of Europe’s little ice age in late medieval era, Super Typhoon Rai slams into the Philippines as tens of thousands evacuate, Crucial Antarctic ice shelf could fail within five years, scientists say, Typhoon Rai rapidly strengthens as it nears the Philippines, New artificial intelligence tool detects most common climate falsehoods, and 2021 was a remarkable year for Earth’s climate.\r\nArticles Linked to on Facebook\r\n\n\tRead more...\n\t0 comments\n\t\r\n\n\tSkeptical Science New Research for Week #50, 2021\n\tPosted on 16 December 2021 by Doug Bostrom, Marc Kodack\n\t89 articles in 45 journals by 574 contributing authors\r\nObservations of climate change, effects\r\nUbiquity of human-induced changes in climate variability Rodgers et al.

The title of the first paper nicely summarizes its key findings: Climate action with revenue recycling has benefits for poverty, inequality and well-being.\r\nCarbon fee and dividend alleviates poverty and income inequality\r\nThe study considered a revenue-neutral carbon fee and dividend structure consistent with achieving the Paris agreement target of limiting global warming to less than 2°C hotter than pre-industrial temperatures. The carbon pricing structure in the paper is similar to that in the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (EICDA), with a few distinctions: \r\n\r\nstarts at an earlier date (2015)\r\nstarts at a higher-level ($30 per ton of carbon dioxide pollution compared to the $15 starting point in EICDA)\r\nrises more slowly (about 5% or $2 per year in the near-term, compared to the $10 per year increase in the EICDA)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we know from the 2020 CCL Household Impact Study, the vast majority of low-income households benefit from receiving a net income as a result of a carbon fee and dividend policy that returns all of the revenue to households in equal increments per person. That’s because low-income households have smaller carbon footprints, and so the dividend is larger than their increase in energy and other product costs.\r\nThe new Nature Climate Change paper confirmed that finding and went further to assess how much poverty and inequality would be reduced as a result. The authors used their Nested Inequalities Climate Economy (NICE) model, which incorporates regional economic distribution data into the climate-economics integrated assessment model for which William Nordhaus won the 2018 Nobel Prize in Economics.\r\nLike the Household Impact Study, the paper then grouped populations by income quintile from the poorest 20% to the wealthiest 20%. The authors evaluated how each income group would be impacted by the carbon price if 100% of dividends were returned equally to individuals; by a carbon price with no dividends; and in a business-as-usual scenario without a carbon price.\r\nThe study concluded that a carbon price without dividends slightly increases income inequality because, even though lower-income households spend fewer dollars on energy than higher-income households, they spend a larger proportion of their income on energy costs. However, when including the equal per capita dividend, the authors found that “climate action involves a synergy with poverty alleviation” and a reduction in income inequality. In the U.S., the study estimated that their modeled carbon fee and dividend structure would lift 1.6 million Americans out of poverty by 2030. It would have even bigger effects if implemented in China and India, as the figure below from the study illustrates. Note that the poverty line is set at different levels in different countries — around a $2 per day income in China and India compared to over $40 per day in the U.S.\r\n\r\n\n\tRead more...\n\t0 comments\n\t\r\n\n\t2021 was a remarkable year for Earth\xe2\x80\x99s climate\n\tPosted on 14 December 2021 by dana1981\n\tThis is a re-post from Yale Climate Connections\r\nThe close of another year provides an opportunity to assess what happened in the worlds of climate science and policy in 2021 and to gaze into a proverbial crystal ball to anticipate likely events in 2022.\r\nThis was a year full of climate-fueled extreme weather events, the publication of important new climate research and synthesis reports, and a crucial international climate negotiation. It ends with anticipation and uncertainty over whether the U.S. Congress will pass the country’s first-ever major climate change legislation.\r\n2021 certainly did not lack for important climate events.\r\nA hot year full of extreme weather\r\nWhen the year comes to a close, 2021 will be the sixth- or seventh-hottest year on record and hotter than any year prior to 2015, despite a La Niña event’s having drawn cold water to the surface of the Pacific Ocean. La Niña years tend to be cooler than years with El Niño or neutral conditions in the Pacific. The year 2000 saw a La Niña event of similar strength to that in 2021, but 2021 was more than 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.75 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than 2000. In short, 2021 was consistent with the long-term human-caused global warming trend of about 0.2°C (0.36°F) per decade.\r\nGlobal average surface temperature change data from the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies divided into El Niño (red), La Niña (blue), and neutral (black) years, and years influenced by the short-term cooling effect of large volcanic eruptions (orange triangles).  Linear best fit trend lines are shown for El Niño, La Niña, and neutral years.
