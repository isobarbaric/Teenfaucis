But how do endosomes find their way over the long distances from the synapse (the space between nerve cells) to the nucleus? Using microfluidic devices and mice, Scaramuzzino et al. found that the endosomes (blue spheres), which are tethered to molecular motors walking along the microtubule network (green rods), carry a calcium-sensing molecule on their surface that provides an internal navigation system to guide them toward the nucleus (orange globe). This work may increase understanding of several neurodegenerative diseases.  \nCredit: Thomas McMahon\n\n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarth, Environmental, Ecological, and Space SciencesBy\n   Hendrik Wouters\n   Jessica Keune\n   et al.\n\nSoil drought can mitigate deadly heat stress thanks to a reduction of air humidityBiomedicine and Life SciencesBy\n   Fang Wang\n   Puwen Tan\n   et al.\n\nSingle-cell architecture and functional requirement of alternative splicing during hematopoietic stem cell formationPhysical and Materials SciencesBy\n   Hailong Wang\n   Shu Zhang\n   et al.\n\nNoninvasive measurements of spin transport properties of an antiferromagnetic insulatorNeuroscienceBy\n   Tim Hahn\n   Jan Ernsting\n   et al.\n\nAn uncertainty-aware, shareable, and transparent neural network architecture for brain-age modelingView Table of Contents\n\nScience ImmunologyVolume 7Issue 67January 2022View CoverONLINE COVER Trail Markers for Tissue Macrophages.

The ability for aerial robots to take off and land on a variety of irregular surfaces will broaden the range of environments where these robots could be deployed. Influenced by how birds take off, land, and grasp, Roderick et al. have developed a bird-inspired grasping system called Stereotyped Nature-inspired Aerial Grasper (SNAG). The researchers integrated SNAG into a quadcopter to demonstrate perching on tree branches of different sizes, orientations, and surface conditions.

This image shows co-expression (yellow) of the oncoprotein Tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3, green) and the acetyltransferase P300 (red) in tumor tissue from a patient with colorectal cancer. Nuclei are shown in blue. Converting immune "cold" tumors that have poor T cell infiltration to highly infiltrated, immune "hot" tumors is a promising strategy to improve outcomes for colorectal cancer. Shang et al. demonstrated that TRIB3 inhibited CD8+ T cell infiltration into colorectal tumors by reducing CXCL10 production. P300-mediated acetylation stabilized TRIB3 protein, which could be reversed by treating colorectal cancer tumor-bearing mice with a P300 inhibitor. Treatment increased CD8+ T cell infiltration into tumors and sensitized them to immune checkpoint blockade, suggesting that TRIB3 may be a useful target for colorectal cancer. \nCredit: Shang et al./Science Translational Medicine\n\n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch ArticlesBy\n   Shuang Shang\n   Yu-wei Yang\n   et al.\n\nTRIB3 reduces CD8+ T cell infiltration and induces immune evasion by repressing the STAT1-CXCL10 axis in colorectal cancerResearch ArticlesBy\n   Deobrat Dixit\n   Briana C.
