Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins.

Though their names were often changed, the gods usually maintained the characteristics of their Greek counterparts.\n                    \n                        \n                            Jupiter\n                        \n                        The chief ancient Roman and Italian god was also called Jove, and like Zeus, the Greek god with whom he is etymologically identical (root diu, \xe2\x80\x9cbright\xe2\x80\x9d), Jupiter was a sky god.\n                    \n                        \n                            Juno\n                        \n                        The female counterpart of Jupiter closely resembled the Greek Hera, with whom she was associated. Juno was connected with all aspects of the life of women, most particularly married life.\n                    \n                        \n                            Minerva\n                        \n                        The god of handicrafts, the professions, the arts, and war was commonly equated with the Greek Athena.\n                    \n                        \n                            Venus\n                        \n                        The ancient Italian god was associated with cultivated fields and gardens and was later identified by the Romans with the Greek god of love, Aphrodite. In legend she was famous for her romantic intrigues and affairs with both gods and mortals.\n                    \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                    The Fastest Animals on Earth\n                    \n                        In the animal kingdom, speed can mean the difference between life and death.

In different areas of Earth, one might find sweltering deserts, dense tropical rainforests, or bone-chilling tundras. Each biome and habitat comes with its own selection of flora and fauna, and it may include physical features such as canyons, volcanoes, rivers, or caves. Human beings have built homes in many different environments, settling the area and organizing it into units such as cities, states, regions, and countries, each with its own points of interest. Shifting trends in human migration have resulted in a human geography that is profoundly different from that of centuries ago.\n\t\n\t\tFeatured\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAfrica\n\t\t\t\tcontinent\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tA Capital Idea\n\t\t\t\tThe city or town that functions as the seat of government...\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe Largest Islands in the World\n\t\t\t\tBig, bigger, biggest.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tHealth & Medicine\n\tThe study of the human mind and body, how these function, and how they interact\xe2\x80\x94not only with each other but also with their environment\xe2\x80\x94has been of utmost importance in ensuring human well-being.

The fight for human and civil rights has persisted for hundreds of years and remains alive today, both within the borders of nations and on an international scale.

Through literature, communication becomes an art, and it can bridge and bond people and cultures of different languages and backgrounds.\n\t\n\t\tFeatured\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tliterary criticism\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHenry IV, Part 1\n\t\t\t\tOne of the throughlines of William Shakespeare\'s Henry...\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGreat Works of Literature\n\t\t\t\tHow well do you know the great works of world literature?...\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tPhilosophy & Religion\n\tHumans have long pondered not only how we came to be but also why we came to be. The earliest Greek philosophers focused their attention upon the origin and nature of the physical world; later philosophers have theorized about the nature of knowledge, truth, good and evil, love, friendship, and much more. Philosophy involves a methodical assessment of any and all aspects of human existence and experience. The realms of philosophy and religion have sometimes intersected in conducting such inquiries as these. As with philosophy, the study of religion underscores how humankind has long speculated about its origins. The possibility of a higher being (or beings) to which livings things owe their existence has long captived human thought. Many religions also offer their own views on the nature of good and evil, and they may prescribe guidelines and judgment on different kinds of human behavior.\n\t\n\t\tFeatured\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tepistemology\n\t\t\t\tphilosophy\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPhilosophers to Know, Part I\n\t\t\t\tFive of the most important thinkers in the history...\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPhilosophers to Know, Part II\n\t\t\t\tFive of the most important thinkers in the history...\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tPolitics, Law & Government\n\tThe world today is divided territorially into more than 190 countries, each of which possesses a national government that claims to exercise sovereignty and seeks to compel obedience to its will by its citizens. Governments can be classified in any number of ways. For example, they might be classified by the number of rulers, thus distinguishing government by one (as in a monarchy or a tyranny) from government by the few (in an aristocracy or oligarchy) and from government by the many (as in a democracy). Governments can also be classified by mode of succession; for example, ascension to governmental leadership may follow the rules of hereditary succession, or it may be determined through elections or by force. Governments also vary in terms of the laws and rules of conduct that each political entity follows.\n\t\n\t\tFeatured\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tpolice\n\t\t\t\tlaw enforcement\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tU.S. Presidential Elections Quiz\n\t\t\t\tWhich day of the week are U.S. presidential elections...\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHow Does the Electoral College Work?\n\t\t\t\tThis is one college that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t offer diplomas.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tScience\n\tHow can the sky be blue one day and stormy the next?

Human beings have long been curious about the world in which we live, striving to identify connections among the phenomenons we witness and to understand how it all works. The field of science has developed over many centuries as a way of studying and understanding the world, beginning with the primitive stage of simply noting important regularities in nature and continuing through the rise of modern science. The modern-day sciences cover a vast range of fields, including biology, chemistry, meteorology, astronomy, physics, and much more.\n\t\n\t\tFeatured\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tanalysis\n\t\t\t\tmathematics\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t7 Questions for Astronaut Jessica Meir\n\t\t\t\tReflections on curiosity and the spirit of exploration.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWe counted 20 billion ticks of an extreme galactic clock to give Einstein\xe2\x80\x99s theory of gravity its toughest test yet\n\t\t\t\tScientists have found that even after 16 years of intensive...\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\tSports & Recreation\n\tPhysical contests and recreational games have long played a part in human society.
