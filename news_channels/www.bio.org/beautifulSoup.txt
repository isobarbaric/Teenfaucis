And even worse, for the patients who need them most.\n\n    \n  \n  \n          \n      \n    \n      Hosted by Dr. Michelle McMurry-Heath.\n\n \n\n    \n  \n  \n      \n        Subscribe\n                          \n      \n    \n  \n                          \n      \n    \n  \n                          \n      \n    \n  \n              \n          \n      \n\n    \n  \n  \n        \n\n            \n                      \n                             \n  \n\n  \n                    \n    \n  \n  \n          \n      \n    \n      Sept 14, 2021\n    \n  \n  \n          \n      \n    \n      The Elephant in the Room: What About HIV?\n    \n  \n  \n          \n      \n    \n      For more than a year now, COVID has been society\xe2\x80\x99s focus\xe2\x80\x94and rightly so. But today we turn our attention to another virus\xe2\x80\x94HIV. After 40 years, there is still no cure or a vaccine for the disease. In this episode, we hear from Dr. Anthony Fauci and CEO of innovative company American Gene Technologies, Jeff Galvin, about the past, present, and future of HIV treatments and medications.
