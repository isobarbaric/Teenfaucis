Sensitive techniques developed over the past 20 years mean that police can now detect minute traces of DNA at a crime scene or on a piece of evidence. But traces from a perpetrator are often mixed with those from many other people that have been transferred to the sample site, for example via a handshake. And this problem has led to\xe2\x80\xa6  \n  \n    \n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope Is Falling (Synopsis)  \n   \n\n\n  \n  "When we meet real tragedy in life, we can react in two ways - either by losing hope and falling into self-destructive habits, or by using the challenge to find our inner strength." -Dalai Lama\nOrbiting at hundreds of miles above Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere, you\xe2\x80\x99d think the Hubble Space Telescope would be safe and stable for a long time.
